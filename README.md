### Project Description
We plan to implement a venue recommendation system for Foursquare users based on their historical check-in records. The data were collected indirectly from the Foursquare check-ins shared on Twitter. Our data contain all such records from Feb. 2014 to Feb. 2015 within New York City. We preprocessed the data using PySpark and extracted 282 MB check-in records from 113 GB geo-tagged tweets. Then, we scraped venue information for each unique venue that users checked in using the Foursquare's Public API.

As for the analysis part, we plan to establish a similarity index for both users and venues, by taking both spatio-temporal and contextual features into account. Techniques potentially involved include collaborative filtering, geospatial clustering, matrix factorization, etc.
